# Blog Frontend – Learning Experience

In this project, I focused on **building simple and clean web pages using Bootstrap**.  
The pages were designed using **HTML structure and Bootstrap classes** to create a
**responsive website** that works well across different screen sizes.

## About This Experience
This project was part of my learning journey, where I practiced:
- Structuring web pages using semantic HTML
- Using Bootstrap grid system and ready-made components
- Building responsive layouts without using a frontend framework
- Organizing views and reusable layouts

The main goal of this project was **learning by building**, not creating a production-ready product.

## Project Scope
- Frontend only
- No backend logic included
- Focused on layout, structure, and responsiveness
- Simple and clear page design

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- Bootstrap
- Blade templates (for layout organization)

## Disclaimer
The CSS and JavaScript files included in this repository are mainly used to **load Bootstrap and its dependencies**.  
No custom CSS styling or JavaScript logic was written as part of this project.

## Notes
This project represents an early learning stage before moving forward to more advanced
backend and frontend technologies.  
It was a valuable and enjoyable experience that helped me understand many web
development fundamentals.
